# The "Rock - Paper - Scissors" Game

This game is usually played between 2 people. Each player simultaneously chooses one of three options 
- r (rock)
- s (scissors)
- p (paper)

This is a console game so we play against randomly generated picks.
The game has 3 outcomes. They are a win, loss or draw.

Lets start a game.
First choose how many games do you want to play:

Next we have to choose one of 3 options that are present on the console. Lets pick rock:

The computer wins this round with paper! So we lose and thats printed on the console with red.
Simultaneusly after the round is over we start the second round and we choose scissos (s):

The computer chose scissors too and we have a draw! Two games have finished and now we print the results
at the end:

As shown above in dark yellow we didn't win any games. Our opponent has 1 win and 1 game is a draw.

Thank you for playing!
